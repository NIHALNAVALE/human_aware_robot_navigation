# social_robot_navigation
This repository simulates a robot in unity simulation, which understands navigation intent from human speech and executes it.

Since the NLP model is developed using Picovoice, the Access Key could be expired and you might be required to create a new account or purchase a plan to work with the model in the future. At the time of writing this documentation,there might be a few days left for Access Key validity, but fret not as we have also included the model's YAML file, all you need to do is create another account on Picovoice and import the YAML file.
